    "text": "This course provides basic mathematical and statistical foundations for students to do more advanced formal theoretical and quantitative empirical research in political science. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, students will learn the tools necessary to analyze and interpret political phenomena through empirical data analysis. This class divides into three modules. The first module covers essential mathematical tools, such as calculus, optimization, and algebra. The second module introduces various statistical concepts, probability theory, and logic of inference. The third module introduces linear regression, which combines all the knowledge learned from the first two modules.\nThroughout this course, we will delve into both the theoretical foundations and practical application of statistics. This will involve exploring crucial theorems as well as acquiring the skills to analyze real-world data effectively."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: This paper differentiates four mechanisms that link firms’ political connections to economic rents and unpack channels through which firms obtain benefits from political ties. Using Chinese public listed firms’ land transaction data as well as a comprehensive dataset of their different types of connections, I differentiate how firms’: (1) reputation, (2) local political influence, (3) access to information, and (4) institutional embeddedness affect land prices and the ways in which firms purchase land. I find that firms with local political influence enjoy a 31% land price discount, the largest compared to other types of connections. More importantly, local connections enable firms to enter into auctions in which they can manipulate land prices before and during the auctions, while firms with good reputations benefit only from restricting potential competitors. My findings demonstrate that different types of political connections differ both in the magnitude of their impacts and the mechanisms by which they work."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Existing theory posits that institutionalized promotion within party systems fosters credible power-sharing in authoritarian regimes, bolstering regime stability and performance. This paper, however, presents evidence indicating that such institutionalization increases protests and reduces regime stability. I argue that the career incentives of politicians within party systems incentivize violations of non-elite property rights, generating distributional injustice and escalating conflicts between governments and citizens. Utilizing data from 600,000 residential land transactions, surveys, and protest records from China, I demonstrate that: 1) local party secretaries with high career incentives tend to manipulate land prices, 2) career-seeking politicians contribute to heightened collective action on land issues, with land price intervention serving as the channel through which career incentives impact collective actions, and 3) distributional injustice is the mechanism drives conflicts between citizens and governments. These findings challenge the notion that institutionalized promotion of party cadres in authoritarian regimes enhances regime stability."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Political institutions influence resource allocation and economic development. However, the connections between political incentives, resource allocation, and macroeconomic growth remain unclear in existing literature. This paper develops a model to explore resource misallocation within a political promotion system. It identifies two types of efficiency losses: “institutional failure,” where principals’ political incentives lead them to formulate policies that deviate from the optimal economic allocation, and “agency failure,” where local leaders’ optimal political resource allocations do not align with those of the principal. The model predicts an “amplifying effect,” wherein institutional failure exacerbates agency failure, causing a greater deviation from the optimal economic allocation. By analyzing the career incentives of both prefecture and provincial leaders in China, this study confirms such an amplifying effect. This paper establishes the connections between political institutions, resource allocations, and economic development."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) is a popular method for flexibly estimating models that may have complex relationships between variables. However, its usefulness to many researchers is limited for two reasons. First, existing approaches are inflexible and do not allow KRLS to be combined with theoretically-motivated extensions such as random effects, unregularized fixed effects, or non-Gaussian outcomes. Second, estimation is extremely computationally intensive for even modestly sized datasets. Our paper addresses both concerns by introducing generalized KRLS (gKRLS). We note that KRLS can be re-formulated as a hierarchical model thereby allowing easy inference and modular model construction where KRLS can be used alongside random effects, splines, and unregularized fixed effects. Computationally, we also implement random sketching to dramatically accelerate estimation while incurring a limited penalty in estimation quality. We demonstrate that gKRLS can be fit on datasets with tens of thousands of observations in under one minute. Further, state-of-the-art techniques that require fitting the model over a dozen times (e.g. meta-learners) can be estimated quickly."
