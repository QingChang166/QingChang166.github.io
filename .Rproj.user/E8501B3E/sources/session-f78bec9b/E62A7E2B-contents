## Goal

This project examines the labor market impacts of the green transition in the United States, focusing on how transitioning to sustainable energy affects employment and workforce dynamics. Additionally, it explores the potential to adapt and apply the concept of a “Just Transition”—ensuring equitable and inclusive shifts in employment opportunities—to the context of China. The project seeks to provide insights into creating sustainable pathways for workers impacted by the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, addressing economic and social challenges on a large scale.
