This is an undergraduate level method course. I'm the teaching assistance for 
Professor Jude Hays. My main duties are two folds: 1) organizing students' discussions
during the class, 2) teaching students to use R during recitations each weak.   

# Course Description

This course introduces students to research methods in political science. Students will learn how political scientists draw statistical and causal inferences from
experimental and observational data to evaluate positive political theory, theory intended
to explain the politics we observe. Do first-past-the-post electoral rules produce two party
systems? Do voters rely on partisan cues? Do democracies go to war with other democracies? The learning objectives are to 1) understand how political scientists use theory and
evidence (i.e., data) to answer important questions like these, and 2) develop basic skills for
data management and analysis.

The course is organized into four main parts. Part I provides foundational knowledge regarding positive political theory, types of inference, and probability. Part II focuses on random
samples and statistical inference. Part III explores random assignment and causal inference with experiments. Part IV presents the idea of random disturbances and develops the model-based approach to statistical and causal inference. A more detailed course schedule with nested subtopics is presented below.
