::: {#hero-heading}
Thanks for visiting my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, affiliated with [the Resileient Economic Lab](https://sites.pitt.edu/~mrfrank/resilientEconomy.html) and the [Responsible Data Science, Complexity, and AI for Peace (ReDSCAIP) Lab](https://michaelcolaresi.com/redscaip).
Recognizing the complex nature of social and political issues, my research leverages large-scale, unstructured real-world data and cutting-edge machine learning architectures to provide insights into [political incentives and development outcomes](articles.qmd), the [labor impacts of energy transitions](articles.qmd), and conflict forecasting.
Additionally, I develop innovative statistical tools that integrate causal inference and machine learning to enhance the rigor of social science research.

Before coming to the University of Pittsburgh, I received my Master degree in Political Science from Duke University and also graduated with a Master degree in Economics from the North Carolina State University.

You can reach me via email: qic108\@pitt.edu.
You can download my [CV](Qing_Chang_CV.pdf).
